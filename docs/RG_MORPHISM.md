1. What is the Purpose of a "Micro NF" (RG-Morphism)?

  The core purpose of an RG-Morphism is to create a compositional and hierarchical 
  library of reusable skills or sub-policies.

  Instead of trying to learn one single, monolithic policy that maps a belief to an
  action, the agent learns many small, specialized "micro-policies." This is
  analogous to learning words instead of trying to memorize every possible sentence.

   * Reusability: A skill like "execute a limit buy" can be reused in many different
     high-level strategies.
   * Adaptability: The agent can adapt to new situations by finding novel ways to
     compose its existing skills.
   * Hierarchy: The agent can learn to "chunk" successful sequences of simple skills
     into a single, more abstract skill, building a hierarchy of capabilities.

  2. How will the Micro NF Work?

  At its core, an RG-Morphism is a small, conditional Normalizing Flow (like our
  ConditionalSplineFlow, but perhaps with fewer layers).

   * Input: It takes a belief about the current state, p(z_t), as input.
   * Transformation: It applies a learned, invertible transformation. This
     transformation represents the effect of executing that specific "skill" on the
     state. For example, a "buy" morphism would transform the belief about our
     portfolio state to a new belief reflecting the purchase.
   * Output: It outputs a new belief, p(z_{t+1}), which is the agent's prediction of
     the state after the skill is applied.
   * Scale-Transformation: The "RG" (Renormalization Group) part of the name implies
     they can also perform explicit scale transformations. For example, a
     "coarse-graining" morphism could take a high-frequency belief (e.g., tick-by-tick)
     and transform it into a lower-frequency representation (e.g., a 1-minute summary),
     which is crucial for hierarchical planning.

  3. What Other Structures Will It Interact With?

  The RG-Morphisms are the building blocks that are orchestrated by several other
  components:

   1. `PolicySelectorVAE` (The "Meta-Planner"): This is the component we just created.
      Its job is to look at the ConsolidatedBeliefState and, instead of choosing a
      single action, it selects a sequence of RG-Morphisms to execute. For example, it
      might propose the sequence ["observe_volatility", "execute_limit_buy"].

   2. `GraphComponentRegistry` (The "Library"): This will be a simple registry (like a
      dictionary) that holds all the available, trained RG-Morphisms so they can be
      looked up by name.

   3. `GraphComposer` (The "Builder"): This is a crucial future component. It will take
      the sequence of morphisms proposed by the PolicySelectorVAE and dynamically build 
      a Forney Factor Graph for that specific plan. It fetches the morphisms from the
      registry and chains them together, creating the full graph that our VMP engine
      will use to calculate the EFE.

  4. How are NFs Selected or Created?

  This is the most exciting part and involves two distinct evolutionary loops:

   1. Selection (Using Existing Skills): The PolicySelectorVAE is responsible for
      selection. It learns, through trial and error (guided by the EFE gradient), which
      combinations and sequences of existing RG-Morphisms are most effective in a given
      situation.

   2. Creation (Learning New Skills): The HierarchyProcessor (a future component for
      structural learning) is responsible for creation. It acts as a "meta-learner" that
      observes the agent's behavior. When it identifies a sequence of morphisms that is
      used frequently and successfully, it can abstract that entire sequence into a 
      single, new RG-Morphism. This new, more powerful "skill" is then added to the
      registry, making it available for the PolicySelectorVAE to select in the future.

  This dual mechanism of selection and creation is what allows the agent to not only get
  better at using its skills but to invent entirely new ones.

  Our immediate next step is to implement the basic RGMorphism class, which is the
  foundation for this entire system. Shall we proceed?

✦ That is the perfect question to ask at this stage. You are right to be critical about
  adding a complex component and to ask what we gain from the additional computation and
   memory.

  You've correctly summarized a Micro-NF's basic function: it's a mapping from one
  belief state to another, associated with an action. The crucial part, and the
  reason it's so powerful, lies in the nature of that mapping and what it enables.

  What We Gain: Abstraction and Structural Learning

  The Forney Factor Graph could function without Micro-NFs, but it would be massively 
  inefficient, inflexible, and incapable of learning new strategies.

  Think of it this way:

   * Without Micro-NFs (The "Monolithic" Graph): To evaluate a policy like "place a
     limit buy, wait 5 seconds, then cancel if not filled," we would have to build one 
     enormous, detailed factor graph from scratch that connects every single primitive
     variable and operation for that entire sequence. If we wanted to evaluate a
     slightly different policy, we'd have to build another, completely different,
     enormous graph. This is computationally explosive and doesn't scale.

   * With Micro-NFs (The "Compositional" Graph):
       1. We have a Micro-NF that has learned the entire sub-graph for "place a limit
          buy." It has encapsulated that complexity.
       2. We have another that has learned "wait 5 seconds."
       3. And a third for "cancel if not filled."

      Now, the GraphComposer doesn't need to build a giant, primitive graph. It can
  simply snap these three high-level, reusable blocks together. This is the gain of
  compositionality and abstraction. It's like writing software using functions and
  libraries instead of just individual lines of assembly code.

  The Deeper Benefit: It's a Learned, Probabilistic Model

  Furthermore, the Micro-NF is not just a simple, defined mapping f(A) = B. It is a
  learned, probabilistic, generative model of that transformation.

   * Probabilistic: It doesn't just output a single next state. It outputs a full
     distribution over possible next states, capturing the inherent uncertainty in the
     outcome of any action.
   * Learned: The agent learns from experience what the true consequences of its
     actions are. The "place limit buy" morphism will learn the subtle dynamics of
     order book fills from real data.
   * Generative: Because it's a Normalizing Flow, the mapping is invertible. We can ask
     not only "what happens if I do this?" but also "what skill should I apply to get to
      this desired state?"

  Conclusion: Why It's Worth the Cost

  You are right, there is a computational cost. But what we gain is the very essence
  of SASAIE:

   * Tractability: It makes planning complex, multi-step policies computationally
     feasible.
   * Hierarchy: It allows the agent to reason at different levels of abstraction.
   * Structural Learning: This is the most important part. The agent can create new 
     Micro-NFs by observing which compositions of old ones are successful. This is how
     the agent learns new, complex skills and truly adapts its own internal structure.
     A monolithic factor graph is structurally fixed; this architecture is not.

  Without the Micro-NFs, the system would be powerful but rigid. With them, it becomes
  genuinely adaptive and capable of emergent intelligence.
