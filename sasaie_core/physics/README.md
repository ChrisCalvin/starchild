# SASAIE Physics-Informed Modeling Submodule

This submodule is dedicated to incorporating principles from physics and applied mathematics to enhance the data-driven models within SASAIE. The goal is to create a hybrid modeling approach that combines the power of deep learning with the robustness and interpretability of physics-based models.

## Current Features

*   **Scattering Feature Engineering (`scattering.py`):** This module calculates advanced features from scattering transform coefficients. These features, such as volatility ratios and lagged differences, are inspired by the physics of multi-scale systems and provide a more robust representation of market dynamics than raw data alone.

## Future Vision: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

The long-term vision for this submodule is to expand into the domain of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This will involve:

*   **Modeling Market Dynamics as PDEs:** We will explore the possibility of modeling certain market dynamics using partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the Black-Scholes equation or other models of stochastic volatility.
*   **PDE-Constrained EFE Calculation:** The EFE calculation will be constrained by these PDEs, ensuring that the agent's plans are consistent with the underlying physics of the market model.
*   **Hybrid Models:** We will develop hybrid models that combine the strengths of data-driven NFs and VAEs with the constraints of PINNs, leading to more robust and generalizable agents.

This submodule represents a key research direction for SASAIE, aiming to bridge the gap between purely data-driven and traditional physics-based modeling.
