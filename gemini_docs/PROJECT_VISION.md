# Online Hierarchical Regime System
## Complete Architecture Documentation

---

## Executive Summary

This system combines **Streaming Matrix Profile**, **Hierarchical VQ-VAE**, and **Active Inference** to create an adaptive, interpretable framework for time series forecasting and control. It learns the "grammar of emergence" - how short-term rules compose into long-term regimes.

### Key Innovation
Instead of a single complex model, we maintain a **dynamically growing library of expert models**, where each expert specializes in a specific regime. The system automatically discovers new regimes and learns their hierarchical structure.

## 1. Core Components

### 1.1 Streaming Matrix Profile (Perception)

**Purpose**: Detect patterns and regime changes in O(n) time

**Key Features**:
- Updates incrementally as new data arrives (not O(n²) recomputation)
- FLOSS algorithm for online regime change detection
- Multi-scale analysis (10, 50, 200 step windows)
- Discord detection for novelty

**Implementation**: Uses STUMPY library
```python
from stumpy import stumpi, floss

# Initialize
stream = stumpi(initial_data, m=window_size, egress=True)

# Update with each new point
stream.update(new_point)
matrix_profile = stream.P_  # O(n) operation
```

**Performance**: ~1ms per update for 1000-point series

---

### 1.2 Hierarchical VQ-VAE (World Model)

**Purpose**: Learn discrete regime library with compositional structure

**Architecture**:
```
Level 3 (Long-term Regimes, m=200)
    ↑ conditions on ↑
Level 2 (Medium Patterns, m=50)
    ↑ conditions on ↑
Level 1 (Short Rules, m=10)
```

**Key Features**:
- Separate codebook per scale
- Cross-attention between levels
- Composition matrices learn emergence rules
- Dynamic codebook growth for novel regimes

**Why VQ-VAE over Matrix Profile alone?**
1. **Generative**: Can forecast, not just detect
2. **Compact**: Single code vs 10,000-dim profile
3. **Compositional**: Learns hierarchy
4. **Probabilistic**: Uncertainty quantification
5. **Evolvable**: Can grow dynamically

---

### 1.3 Continual Learning (Evolution)

**Purpose**: Learn new regimes without forgetting old ones

**Method**: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)
- Computes Fisher Information Matrix on old regimes
- Penalizes changes to "important" parameters
- Fine-tunes on novel patterns in ~5 epochs

**When to Adapt**:
- **Distance > 0.5**: Add new codebook entry
- **0.3 < Distance < 0.5**: Fine-tune existing code
- **Distance < 0.3**: Use existing code

**Maintenance** (every 100 steps):
- Update Fisher matrix
- Prune unused codes
- Retrain expert models
- Balance replay buffer

---

### 1.4 Expert Bank (Forecasting)

**Purpose**: Regime-specific forecasters

**Structure**:
```python
expert_bank = {
    regime_0: ARForecaster(),  # Trending expert
    regime_1: ARForecaster(),  # Volatile expert
    regime_2: ARForecaster(),  # Stable expert
    ...
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Specialization: Each expert optimized for one regime
- Interpretability: "In trending regime, do X"
- Modularity: Add/remove experts independently
- Efficiency: Simple models work when regime is known

---

### 1.5 Active Inference Planner (Action Selection)

**Purpose**: Minimize Expected Free Energy across timescales

**EFE Calculation**:
```
EFE = Pragmatic Value - Epistemic Value

Pragmatic = Expected reward given beliefs
Epistemic = Expected information gain
```

**Policy Types**:
1. **EXPLOIT**: High confidence → use learned strategy
2. **EXPLORE**: Low confidence → gather information
3. **PREPARE**: Transition imminent → conservative actions
4. **ADAPT**: Novel regime → cautious strategy

**Hierarchical Planning**:
- Weights scales by importance (short > medium > long)
- Considers regime stability
- Anticipates transitions using composition learning

```
New Observation

    ↓
[2] Encode to Regime Codes (hierarchically)

    ├─ Level 2: code=7, distance=0.31  
    └─ Level 3: code=2, distance=0.18
    ↓

## 3. Hierarchical Composition Learning

### 3.1 The "Ruliad" Insight

**Question**: Do short-window motifs (rules) generate long-term patterns?

**Answer**: YES. The system learns:

```
Short Rules (m=10)        Medium Patterns (m=50)      Long Regimes (m=200)
├─ spike-revert      ──→  consolidation          ──→  range-bound
├─ steady-climb      ──→  breakout               ──→  trending
└─ oscillate         ──→  volatile-chop          ──→  uncertain
```

### 3.2 Composition Matrix

Learns P(pattern_k | rules_{k-1}):

```python
composition_matrix[i, j] = probability that
    rule j at level k-1
    participates in pattern i at level k
```

**Example**:
- Pattern "breakout" (level 2, code 5) composed of:
  - 60% "steady-climb" (level 1, code 2)
  - 30% "volume-spike" (level 1, code 7)
  - 10% other

### 3.3 Discovery Process

1. Use STUMPY's `ostinato()` to find consensus motifs at each scale
2. Use `snippets()` to extract representative patterns
3. Compute which short motifs appear in each long pattern
4. Train composition matrices on co-occurrence statistics
